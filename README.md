My name is __Florian Vazelle__, I'm a master degree student @ [🏫 ESGI](https://www.esgi.fr/) in computer graphics.  
You can see me on [🎮 Itch.io](http://florianvazelle.itch.io/), [🧠 StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/9741124/florianvazelle?tab=profile) and [👔 LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/florianvazelle).

I'm currently learning __Vulkan__ and to understand it, I'm working on :
- 🔭 [VulkanStarter](https://github.com/florianvazelle/VulkanStarter/), to set up a simple template with build system (CMake), package manager (Conan) and CI (Github Actions).
- 🏗️ [vk3DLoader](https://github.com/florianvazelle/vk3DLoader/), to extend VulkanStarter by visualizing and loading 3D models.
- 📚 [French Vulkan Tutorial](https://fyc-vulkan-equipe-7.gitbook.io/fyc-vulkan/), written with my friends, to explain what we learn.
