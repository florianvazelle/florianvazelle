My name is __Florian Vazelle__, I'm a Back-End Developer @ [🦉 HarfangLab](https://www.harfanglab.io/), previously, master degree student @ [🏫 ESGI](https://www.esgi.fr/) in computer graphics.  

<!--
I learned __Vulkan__ and to understand it, I worked on :
- 🔭 [VulkanStarter](https://github.com/florianvazelle/VulkanStarter/), to set up a simple template with build system (CMake), package manager (Conan) and CI (Github Actions).
- 🖼️ [vk3DLoader](https://github.com/florianvazelle/vk3DLoader/), to extend VulkanStarter by visualizing and loading 3D models.
- 📚 [French Vulkan Tutorial](https://fyc-vulkan-equipe-7.gitbook.io/fyc-vulkan/), written with my friends, to explain what we learn.
- ✨ [vkMpm](https://github.com/florianvazelle/vkMpm/), to extend VulkanStarter by simulating physics with a particle system (+ android compatible app).

I'm currently learning __Rust__ and to understand it, I'm work on :
- 🌠 [A Blender Addon](https://github.com/florianvazelle/refactored-bone-generator), with a rust backend, to compute operations quickly.
- ⚙️ [UNO R3](https://github.com/florianvazelle/uno-r3), to discover embedded programming.
